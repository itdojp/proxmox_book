## 2. Purpose and big picture


Summarize how Proxmox VE can be integrated into enterprise environments and present anonymized, pattern-based design guidance.




## 3. Context and orientation


- Last main chapter; audience includes decision-makers and senior engineers.


Files:
- `manuscript/ja/part4/chapter10-enterprise.md`




## 4. Constraints and assumptions


- No direct customer names; all examples anonymized.
- Focus on patterns and lessons learned.
- Keep guidance vendor-neutral where possible, emphasizing integration principles rather than specific products.




## 5. Plan of work


- Phase 1: Identify key integration themes (ID management, backup, monitoring, etc.).
- Phase 2: Draft anonymized case patterns.
- Phase 3: Extract general design guidelines.




## 6. Concrete steps


- [x] List integration touchpoints with typical enterprise systems.
- [x] Draft 2–3 scenario-based sections that are anonymized but realistic.
- [x] Summarize do's and don'ts as design guidelines.




## 7. Validation and acceptance


- [x] Content is realistic, technically sound, and respects confidentiality by using anonymized, pattern-based scenarios.




## 8. Progress


- [2025-11-16 12:08] Plan created.
- [2025-11-16 15:25] Drafted `manuscript/ja/part4/chapter10-enterprise.md` with integration touchpoints, anonymized scenarios, and design do's/don'ts.




## 9. Surprises & discoveries


- Focusing on integration themes (ID, backup, monitoring, security) provides enough structure for enterprise readers without needing specific customer stories.




## 10. Decision log


- Decision: Use scenario-based descriptions that abstract away customer identities and concrete numbers, while still conveying realistic integration patterns.




## 11. Outcomes & retrospective


- Initial draft of Chapter 10 exists at `manuscript/ja/part4/chapter10-enterprise.md`, summarizing key enterprise integration touchpoints and anonymized patterns.
- The chapter avoids naming specific products or customers, making it safer to maintain and adapt as new experiences accumulate.
- For future pattern-based chapters, this structure (touchpoints → scenarios → do/don't) appears effective at keeping content both concrete and reusable.




## 12. Idempotence & recovery


- Examples can be expanded or updated as new projects and experiences accumulate.
